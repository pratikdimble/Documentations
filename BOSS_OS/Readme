National Resource Centre for Free and Open Source Software (NRCFOSS) at C-DAC Chennai as a part of its objective has been working on localised Indian distribution of GNU/Linux called Bharat Operating Systems Solutions (BOSS) based on Debian. 
BOSS GNU/Linux is available as Desktop edition, Server edition and as EduBOSS. BOSS Linux is targeted towards Government departments / SME's / schools and the first time user.
A second target group is the Linux distro (distribution) developers so that they can develop a new distro based on BOSS Linux.
